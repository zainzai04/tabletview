            <img src="pets/images/bacon.jpg" width = "400" alt="Brown labradoodle wearing colorful lei">

            <p>Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days lounging among the three different beds/couches that his family has gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long as he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to admit he has no wolf-like skills in chasing them.</p> 
            <P>At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release all of his energy. He will place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.</P>

            Biscuit is a 2 year old shiba inu dog. Shiba inus are energetic and playful dogs. Biscuit
            enjoys running outside in circles and then laying down in the grass in the sun for hours.

            <p>

            <p>Lucy is a 17-year-old calico that I've had since I was 5, she has pretty much grown up with me my whole life. 
                Even though she's old she's still kickin' it and enjoys running around the house at 4am.</P>
            <p>
                Her favorite foods include anything but her kibble. She enjoys sunbathing and long naps, 
                along with lots of petting. However, she hates getting her stomach rubbed.</p>

            <img src="pets/images/rosie.PNG" width = "400" alt="Brown and White Bichon/Shitzhu mix">
    
            <p>Rosie is a small but super energetic dog. Whenever someone comes to the house she is 
                very quick to run up and greet them. She loves to play fetch and will not leave you 
                alone with her toys as she begs you to play with her.</P>
            <p>
                Rosie is also a wonderful lap dog. If you sit on the couch she is quick to find a 
                spot next to you. If you wear a blanket over your legs, youâ€™ll find her laying on 
                your legs. She loves to cuddle and loves to be pet so she will always be right up 
                on you.</p>

            <p>Sofie is a 15-year-old Beagle mix.  Her favorite spot in the house is the living room couch. 
                She loves to go outside, sometimes too much, leaving us to open the door for her constantly.
                Sofie loves freshly cut grass, she rolls around in it for hours after it gets cut. </P>
            <p>
                Sofie is very old, she joined our family when I was still in a car seat.
                Sofie loves the weekends because she gets her favorite treat, a fried egg. 
                Sofie loves long walks around the lake or on the trail, where she can be let free to 
                run to her hearts content.</p>
